# Adams-Wordle

My take on the Wordle game which I have created in PyCharm with Tkinter.

Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of coloured tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.

I have used Python and Tkinter GUI to recreate the Wordle game but for a Windows environment as an app instead of a website-based game.

I have made this as a side project during my school holidays to develop my skills. 

# How to install and Run the game:

I have included a .exe version of the code which can be run from the Windows

OR

I have also included the whole code file plus the file which contains the
wordle words themselves selfs which can be run for example from PyCharm.

# How to play the game:

Compared to the Wordle version in the New York Times, this one can generate new words unlimitedly, during the play after it's won or lost.

The Player has 6 tries to guess the correct 5-letter word, and after every guess, each letter is marked as either gree, orange or grey.

Green means that the letter is correct and in the correct position.

Orange means that the letter is present in the word but it is not currently in the correct position.

Gray means that the letter is not in the word at all.

There is a virtual qwerty keyboard too which is also functional and the colours of the keys change as well depending on how the game goes.

The application will not accept shorter words than 5 and also there is en_UK spelling check build so the entered words by the player need to actually
be English wordss.


# I am still working on improving the code and making it more simplified.
